#Cognex Vision Compression Tool

This project was created for a series of Cognex Vision Systems in a production environment. The script reduces the size of the saved images by converting them from bmp to jpg and then creates a daily archive of images each day which allows the images to be stored for the long term. The scripts are developed in Python and run off a batch file controlled by Windows Task Scheduler.
